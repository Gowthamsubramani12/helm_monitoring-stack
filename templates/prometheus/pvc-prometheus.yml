# However, the StatefulSet uses volumeClaimTemplates which is the standard way to handle storage for StatefulSets.
# This file is included to satisfy the specific file structure requirement but might not be used if the StatefulSet handles it.
# If you want a shared PVC for some reason (not recommended for Prometheus), you can use this.
